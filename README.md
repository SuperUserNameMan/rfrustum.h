# rscenegraph.h
WIP basic scene-graph with frustrum culling for Raylib

- [x] `frustum.h` : contains basic frustum functions ;
- [x] `rnodes.h` : contains API to create scene-graph / node-graph manually ;
- [ ] `rscenegraph.h` : WIP 


STATUS: 
- ~~A little busy fixing some issues on an other repo, but i'll come back finishing this project ASAP.~~ that was https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/pull/4151
- Raylib is a nice and seductive little project, but I'm currently evaluating migrating to Godot and `GDextension` to avoid wasting time and energy trying to workaround heavy code-debt and maintainance inertie.
