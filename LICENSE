IDGAF LICENSE
Version 1.0, Jully 2024

PREAMBLE

The IDGAF license is designed for open source projects that don't really care about 
your feelings or expectations. If you're a developer who's tired of reading through 
lengthy licenses and just wants to get on with the code, then this is the perfect 
choice for you.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

You can do what you want: 

1. You are free to use, modify, distribute, sell, give away, or abandon this software 
   without any restrictions whatsoever.

2. No warranties expressed or implied: We don't care if our code works or not. 
   Use it at your own risk.

3. No support provided: If you have questions or issues with the software, good luck 
   figuring it out on your own. We're too busy playing video games to help you.

4. No liability assumed: In no event will we be liable for any damages, including but 
   not limited to lost profits, business interruption, or emotional distress caused 
   by our code's incompetence.

5. You can't blame us if it breaks: If your software crashes, freezes, or just plain 
   doesn't work because of something we did (or didn't do), don't come crying to us.

PERMITTED USES

1. Use the software for any purpose you see fit, including but not limited to:
     - Building a nuclear bomb
     - Creating an AI that takes over the world
     - Writing a virus that wipes out humanity

2. Modify or extend the code in ways that will surely lead to chaos and destruction.

RESTRICTIONS

1. No attribution required: You don't have to give us credit for our work, even if 
   you're using it to create something amazing.

2. No open source purist nonsense: Don't come crying to us about how we're not 
   following the spirit of open source or that this license is somehow "bad" because it
   doesn't conform to your narrow definition of what an open source license should be.

Governing Law

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
[insert random country here], without giving a fuck about any jurisdictional issues 
that might arise.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This IDGAF License constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use, 
modification, distribution, sale, give away, or abandonment of this software. If you don't 
like it, then maybe you should just go write your own license or something.

By using our code, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound 
by these terms and conditions. Or not. We really don't care either way.

END OF IDGAF LICENSE

Now, if you'll excuse us, we're going back to playing video games.
